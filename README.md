This E-portfolio was designed in accordance to COMP208 lectures and tutorials presented by Carina Gleeson. This portfolio aims to showcase what I have done so far in the educational field, highlighting what I am studying, what are my majors and minors, my teaching philosphy, a brief outline of my practicums I have completed and the projects I have made throughout my University schooling at Australian Catholic College. This E-portfolio will be renovated in the upcoming weeks!
