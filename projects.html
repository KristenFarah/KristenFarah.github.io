            <h4>TECH211</h4>
            <p>In TECH211, our assignment was to create food moulds for a need. My project was to make a meal kit, designed for chefs working at a nursing home, to use for the elderly in the home. The main target market for this kit was designed for those with dysphagia who had difficulties with swallowing.</p>

            <h4>TECH306</h4>
            <p>For TECH306, our assignment was to find an everyday product on the market, pull it apart and discover how to make it better. Through primary and secondary research, I was able to complete my project on the Woolworths Beef Lasagne. Over the semester I conducted experiments into how to make it more sustainable, nutritionally dense and appealing to a broader market.</p>

            <h4>TECH205</h4>
            <p>In TECH205, our assignment was to use veneer and implement it into a design. For this project, I created a small serving tray designed for two teacups and a miniture teapot. I was able to embed the veneer into the tray through the checker style of contrasting veneers.</p>

            <h4>TECH205</h4>
            <p>In TECH205, our assignment was to create a footstool for Taronga Zoo's merchandise store. My final project is symbolic of an arabian oryx (nearly extinct animal). My decision to have the stool inspired by this animal was to raise awareness. </p>
